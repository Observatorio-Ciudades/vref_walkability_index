# Walkability Index Estimation – Project Repository

Project Title: From Accessibility Measures to the Understanding of Walkability

Partners: Universidad EAFIT (Colombia) & Tecnológico de Monterrey (Mexico)

Funding: Volvo Research and Educational Foundations (VREF)

## Overview

This repository contains the scripts, Jupyter notebooks, sample data, and results developed as part of the research project From Accessibility Measures to the Understanding of Walkability. The project aims to bridge the gap between accessibility (how close services are) and actual pedestrian experience (whether people actually walk), particularly in complex and unequal urban contexts like those found in Latin America. 

Although walking remains one of the most common modes of transport in cities like Medellín and Guadalajara, traditional planning tools rarely capture how people perceive walking conditions. This project proposes a Walkability Index (WI) that integrates both objective spatial indicators and subjective perceptions from pedestrians to provide a more nuanced, context-sensitive measurement of walkability.

## What’s in This Repository? 

This repository includes: 

- Scripts and Notebooks used to preprocess data, estimate walkability variables, and calculate the WI. 
- Input Data Samples (e.g., population, street network, sidewalk layers, NDVI). 
- Output Maps and Results from the analysis in Medellín (Colombia) and Guadalajara (Mexico). 
- Survey structure for perception data collection. 
- Documentation to replicate or adapt the WI methodology to other cities.

## Step-by-Step Methodology 

The Walkability Index is calculated per street segment using the equation:

$$
WI = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \beta_i \cdot X_i
$$

Where, $X_i$ is the normalized value of the physical variable i. $\beta_i$ is the perception-based coefficient from pedestrian responses.

1. Selection of Variables 

    Based on the "3D" framework: Density, Diversity, Design. 

    Variables include: 
    - Population Density.
    - Intersection Density.
    - Land Use Mix (Entropy Index).
    - Vegetation (NDVI).
    - Slope.
    - Sidewalk Availability.

2. Normalization of Physical Variables 

    All variables are normalized using min-max scaling to allow comparison on a common scale. 

3. Collection of Perception Data 

    In each study neighborhood, pedestrians were surveyed about their perception of the walking environment. 

    Responses were used to estimate $\beta$ (beta) coefficients reflecting the importance of each variable to the walking experience. 

4. Mapping and Visualization 

    WI is calculated at the street segment level to reflect local variations in walkability.  

    Results are visualized using maps, charts, and comparative analyses across neighborhoods and cities. 

## Who Can Use This? 

- Urban planners.
- Transportation researchers.
- Local governments.
- Students and academics interested in mobility, urban equity, and GIS.

## How to Use 

1. Clone the repository: 

    git clone https://github.com/Observatorio-Ciudades/vref_walkability_index.git 

2. Install required Python packages: 

    pip install -r requirements.txt 

3. Run the processing pipeline: 

    - Step 1: Prepare the initial network. 
     (notebooks/01_PL_(…).ipynb) 
    - Step 2: Process physical variables: map raw data to each segment of the network. 
     (notebooks/02_PV_(…).ipynb) 
    - Step 3: Calculate perception variables for each study area. 
     (notebooks/03_BT_(…).ipynb) 
    - Step 4: Compute the Walkability Index. 
    (notebooks/04_04_WI_01_Walkability_Index.ipynb) 

    Replace sample data with your own to apply this model to new cities. 

    The code is modular and adaptable. You can replace the input layers with your city’s data and apply the same methodology to estimate walkability in your own context. Feel free to contribute, fork, or contact the project team for collaborations or implementation support.
